# Hercynia, fall 5014U
The Arc Hounds face defeat for the first time against the overwhelming force of the machine horde. However, with cunning and luck, they are able to rescue the members of CRT Contingency White and deal at serious blow against a target asset of the machine horde. With only one thing left to do before the main attack.

After rescuing CRT Contingency White, the Arc hounds are directed to Contingency White's subline corvette with the intention of traveling with the team to the SecCom orbital platform Cassander housing the kinetic kill-rod system used by **Beggar one** to reduce **Daylight** to ashes and dust. When arriving to the corvette, the Arc Hounds are met with a small group of the remaining grey town refugees that had taken up shelter in the corvette before it we. Tiana directed the group out, with encouraging words of their future success.
